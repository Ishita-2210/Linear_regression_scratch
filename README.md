## Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. This project demonstrates the core principles behind linear regression, including:

- Calculating the best-fit line parameters (slope and intercept) using the least squares method.
- Predicting new data points.
- Measuring performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Features

- Implementation of linear regression without external ML libraries.
- Training function to fit model parameters.
- Prediction function for new inputs.
- Performance evaluation using MSE.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code.
